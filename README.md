# A Portfolio Website

##### Using CSS and SASS to build a website

#### By Griffin P Longtin, 12/8/17

## Description

_This website is a portfolio template using CSS and SASS elements with a focus on trying out animations. We have 4 wireframe sketches, two detailed for three viewports (desktop, table and mobile). This particular plan is for our circle navigation wireframe. Our design is minimalistic with a focus on showcasing a designer's work or portfolio within this site._

## Feedback

_Well I learned a lot. I feel like I could have learned more about scss file structure. I spent a lot of time trying to learn more about it. What I got from that was that the files are mostly determined by the project. The planning part of this week when confusing at some points. I found it hard to plan uses of things like mixins. I learned that implementation is easier when you have a plane. Knowing a general idea of what you are doing, what needs to be done, and what goes where makes the build proses less stressful. Also knowing what is in your scope and helps to prevent scope creep. What did not work for me was I was thinking about to much. I think I need to work on one section and a time and make their styles more reusable throughout the project._

## What I will do Different

I am going to work on using more sass tools. I will definitely use more mixins and more extend if possible. Want to make my stylesheet more framework.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Open up terminal and type in: cd ~
* Then type in: cd Desktop
* Then type in: git clone: https://github.com/Griflongtin/week-3
* Then go to your Desktop and find the new file called Office-365, Open it.
* Then just open the index.html file.

## Specs

| # | Spec | Example |
|---|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | The site includes 4 sections, including: Navigation, Header, Footer and Main. | Example: Header contains Logo and 4 links for: Project Gallery, Experience/Resume, Bio/Mission Statement and Contact. |
| 2 | The Footer section contains a sitemap, an anchor to the page and potentially repeats some of the Header links or Social Links. | Example: Footer's Sitemap contains more quick links to the rest of the portfolio. |
| 3 | The Main section contains an animated navigation element, which when clicked, opens a modal of content for that section. | Example: Footer's Sitemap contains more quick links to the rest of the portfolio. |
| 4 | The Navigation section contains an animated navigation element, which when clicked, opens a modal of content for that section. | Example: Navigation element links to 4 sections: Project Gallery, Experience/Resume, Bio/Mission Statement and Contact. |

## SASS Use Cases

| # 	| SASS Use Cases 	|
|---	|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| 1 	| We will use SASS nesting to help create an animated navigation element. 	|
| 2 	| We will use SASS mixins for media queries and possibly color mixes. 	|
| 3 	| We will use SASS variables for colors, fonts, etc. 	|
| 4 	| We are using SASS partials like variables and component pages to split up and organize code. 	|
| 5 	| We created modules.scss files and using the SASS @import to pull necessary code into CSS file. 	|
| 6 	| We will use SASS @extend to reuse properties on several elements. 	|
| 7 	| We will interpolation: #{} syntax for when we write a for each loop to create our columns and grid 	|
| 8 	| We will use SASS @extend to reuse properties on several elements. 	|
